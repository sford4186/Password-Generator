When button is clicked...

prompt user for how many characters they would like their password to contain

prompt user if they would like special characters

prompt user if they would like lowercase characters

prompt user if they would like uppercase characters in their password

prompt user if they would like numbers in their password

if special{
calculate one character, add to the password 
concatenate the totalarray with the special array
}
if lower{
calculate one character, add to the password 
concatenate the totalarray with the special array
}
if upper{
calculate one character, add to the password 
concatenate the totalarray with the special array
}
if numbers{
calculate one character, add to the password 
concatenate the totalarray with the special array
}

when you get here you have the password with 2 characters then you need to calculate 8 more
loop and pick random characters from the totalarray

return password

  confirmNum = confirm("Select 'OK' if you would like numbers in your password")

  for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {

    alert("Password length must be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters")
  }
  else {

      }
      else {

      }

      if (confirmSpecial === true) {
        getRandomSpecial()
        
      }
      else {
        newSpecial = ""
      }


      return passcode = newLow + newPass + newUpper + newSpecial

    }
